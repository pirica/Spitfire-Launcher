## Installation

Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/bur4ky/spitfire-launcher/releases/latest) page or from [our website](https://rookie-spitfire.xyz/launcher).

- **Windows:** `Spitfire.Launcher_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`
- **Android:** `Spitfire.Launcher_x.x.x.apk`

## Good to Know

On first install, SmartScreen may show a blue warning. This happens because the launcher isn't code‑signed (as signing is expensive). You can safely click "Run anyway" to continue the installation.

Settings are stored in:

- **Windows:** `C:/Users/USERNAME_HERE/AppData/Roaming/spitfire-launcher`
- **Android:** `/data/user/0/com.spitfire_launcher.app` (Requires root access)

### Bulk Actions

### Game & Account Management
